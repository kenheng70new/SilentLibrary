                      <strong>The murders of four innocent college students attending the University of Idaho left us all with so many questions.
                        Now, after more than 300 interviews, James Patterson and prize-winning journalist Vicky Ward finally have some answers.                  
                        We know what it was like to live in Moscow, Idaho, on November 13, 2022, the day of the cold-blooded killings. 
                        We know what the local police and FBI did right. And what they did wrong. 
                        We’ve learned so much about the four heartbroken families—the Mogens, Goncalveses, Kernodles, and Chapins.
                        And we have the backstory for Bryan Kohberger, brilliant grad student, loner, apparent incel.
                        Now you are the jury.
                        The evidence is in.
